# Simple FTUX Swipeable Pages

A simple UICollectionView that works as a slideshow for first-time users to learn about App X.

This project is truly nothing special and only serves as a repo for techniques I am saving for use at a later date.

## Things I put or used in here
 - Support for landscape
 - UIColor extension
 - UIPageControl
 - Setup property configuration as closure
 - Storyboard-less project setup
 - `NSLayoutConstraint.activate` to avoid `isActive = true`
 - `.addTarget` method
 - `.scrollToItem` method
